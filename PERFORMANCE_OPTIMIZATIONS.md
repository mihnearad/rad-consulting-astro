# Performance Optimization Summary

## Completed Optimizations (October 1, 2025)

### âœ… Image Optimization - Est. Savings: ~650 KiB

#### Unsplash Images (Services Section)
**Before**: Images were loading at full resolution (1974px-2070px wide)
**After**: Optimized to 826px width (2x for retina displays)

Changes made to `/components/Services/services.astro`:
- IT Consulting image: 1974px â†’ 826px (w parameter)
- Data Analysis image: 2070px â†’ 826px
- IT Support image: 2070px â†’ 826px  
- Project Management image: 2070px â†’ 826px

All images now use:
- `w=826` (width parameter for 413px display at 2x)
- `h=480` (height parameter for 240px display at 2x)
- `q=80` (quality set to 80)
- Removed `.jpg` extension to let Unsplash serve optimized format

**Expected savings**: ~600 KiB

#### Logo Optimization
**Before**: Logo loaded without explicit dimensions (3160x1858px source)
**After**: Added explicit width/height attributes

Changes made to `/components/navbar.astro`:
- Added `width={95} height={56}` to logo Image component
- Allows browser to optimize rendering and prevent layout shift

**Expected savings**: ~44 KiB (through browser optimization)

### âœ… JavaScript Loading Chain Optimization

**Before**: 884ms critical path with chained resource loading
**After**: Optimized with resource hints and connection pre-establishment

#### Changes Made:

1. **Resource Hints Added** (`/src/pages/index.astro`):
   - `<link rel="preconnect">` for critical third-party domains:
     - `cdn.kiprotect.com` (consent management)
     - `www.googletagmanager.com` (analytics)
     - `images.unsplash.com` (service images)
   - `<link rel="dns-prefetch">` for early DNS resolution
   
2. **Script Loading Optimization**:
   - Removed unnecessary preload hints for deferred scripts
   - Klaro scripts remain deferred (non-critical for initial render)
   - Google Analytics loads conditionally via consent manager

3. **Build Configuration** (`astro.config.mjs`):
   - Added `modulePreload: { polyfill: false }` to reduce overhead
   - Added `format: 'file'` for cleaner URLs
   - Existing code splitting maintained for vendor and swiper chunks

#### Expected Impact:
- **DNS lookup time**: Reduced by ~20-100ms per domain
- **Connection time**: Reduced by ~50-200ms with preconnect
- **Critical path**: Estimated reduction of 100-300ms
- **Total improvement**: ~200-400ms faster initial load

**Note**: The 884ms bottleneck also includes Cloudflare/email-decode which is outside our control but required for email obfuscation.

## Remaining Recommendations

### ðŸ”´ Priority: robots.txt Validation Error
- **Issue**: Unknown directive `Content-signal: search=yes,ai-train=no` on line 29
- **Status**: Needs investigation - not found in current source code
- **Impact**: May affect search engine crawling

### ðŸŸ¡ Cache Headers Configuration - Est. Savings: 80 KiB
- **Affected resources**:
  - `kiprotect.com` resources (consent management)
  - `digitaloceanspaces.com` resources (CDN icons)
- **Recommendation**: Increase cache TTL to 1 year for static assets
- **Note**: Requires server/CDN configuration changes

### ðŸŸ¡ JavaScript Loading Chain - 884ms Critical Path
- **Issue**: `hoisted-bJqvPHU8.js` creates network bottleneck
- **Current**: 884ms maximum critical path latency
- **Recommendations**:
  1. Use `<link rel="preload">` for critical JavaScript
  2. Consider code splitting for non-critical features
  3. Evaluate async/defer strategies for third-party scripts

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Run Lighthouse audit** after deployment to verify improvements
2. **Monitor Core Web Vitals**:
   - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) should improve with image optimization
   - CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) should improve with explicit logo dimensions
3. **Test on slow 3G** to verify perceived performance improvements

## Implementation Notes

- All changes maintain existing functionality
- Image quality remains high (q=80) while reducing file size
- Retina displays still receive high-quality images (2x resolution)
- No breaking changes to component APIs
