## üîç How to Validate Changes

### 1. Test Structured Data
**Tool**: [Google Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)

Test these URLs:
- `https://rad-digitalsolutions.com/faq` (should show FAQPage schema)
- `https://rad-digitalsolutions.com/services/it-consulting` (should show Service + Breadcrumb)
- `https://rad-digitalsolutions.com/use-cases/enterprise-network-modernization` (should show Article + Breadcrumb)

### 2. Check Sitemap
Visit: `https://rad-digitalsolutions.com/sitemap-index.xml`
- Should see all 4 use-case pages listed
- Should see proper priorities and change frequencies

### 3. Verify Robots.txt
Visit: `https://rad-digitalsolutions.com/robots.txt`
- Should see all use-case Allow directives

### 4. Test Performance
**Tool**: [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
- Test homepage for LCP improvements
- Check WebP image delivery
- Verify fetchpriority is working

### 5. Check Security Headers
**Tool**: [Security Headers](https://securityheaders.com/)
- Should see A or A+ rating
- All 5 security headers should be present

### 6. Monitor Search Console
**Google Search Console** (after 2-4 weeks):
- Check "Enhancements" > "Breadcrumbs" (should show valid breadcrumbs)
- Check "Enhancements" > "FAQ" (should show valid FAQ schema)
- Monitor "Coverage" for use-case page indexing

---

## üìù Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

4. **Reading Time Meta Tags** - For use-case articles
5. **rel="noopener"** audit - Verify all external links

### Low Priority (Future Considerations)
1. **Multilingual Support** - hreflang tags if expanding to other languages
2. **AMP Pages** - Mobile-optimized versions (Astro already fast)
3. **PWA Features** - Service worker, offline capability
4. **Video Schema** - If adding more video content
5. **How-to Schema** - For tutorial content

## üîß Technical Notes

### Service Schema Already Existed
All three service pages already had Service structured data - we only added breadcrumbs to them.

### TypeScript Warning (Non-Breaking)
The `fetchpriority` attribute on the video element shows a TypeScript warning because it's not in the type definition yet. This is safe to ignore - the attribute works in all modern browsers.

### CSP Policy
The Content-Security-Policy is configured to allow:
- Google Tag Manager (required for analytics)
- Klaro (cookie consent)
- Google Fonts
- Unsplash images

If you add other external services, you may need to update the CSP in `src/middleware.ts`.

### HSTS Header Commented Out
The Strict-Transport-Security header is commented out in middleware.ts. Uncomment it only after confirming SSL/HTTPS is working properly on your production domain.
